Hi Sir/Ma'am, 
Hope you are doing well. 

I would like to share a final standpoint from our end. 

1. We have cancelled your booking upon your request. 

2. In case you wish to avail any other service, please feel free to place another booking on the website. 

3. An onboarding manager will call you and you will be required to pay a subscription fee again, because the last subscription that you availed has been cancelled. 

4. However, if you wish to resume the current subscription and we receive your approval on the same, we will start searching for a helper from that very date and follow the replacement policy of 10 days.

5. Also, our subscription cannot be paused or kept on hold at any moment during its tenure, so we will be providing you with the services for the number of days pending in the tenure on a pro-rata basis. 

In case you have any queries, please feel free to get in touch with me. I would be happy to help you.

Regards,
Sparsh

Hi Sir/Ma'am,
Thank you for your honest feedback.

I will make sure that the same is forwarded to the helper for her betterment.

However, in similar situations, our next steps of the process will be as follows:

1. We will forward this feedback to our trainer, and they will mediate it with the helper. They will also check if the current helper can be reassessed or not. If yes, we will do that and ask her to rejoin, because we believe in giving our helpers a Second Chance.

2. Since, it was just the first/second/third day of work, we would really appreciate it if you could allow the helper at least 3-5 days to adjust and adapt to the work at your location, because it might take a few more days for them to understand and respond accordingly in terms of work.

3. We will definitely inform her to follow all the basic hygiene measures. Please do not worry about this.

4. Despite this, in case she shows no signs of improvement, we will definitely provide you with a replacement helper within 10 days after this and make sure that the similar issues do not arise in the future.

This will be the basic protocol that we will be following. Please let us know if there is anything else that I can do to assist you better.

Regards,
Sparsh
